After being a nuisance for past months and years of my college life. Being fed-up of not doing anything fruitful in the tech field. In the field of exploration and extra curricular i would have done better than 99.99 % of people of my college. But certainly that would build some thing , has built something. The few connections across, the medals and the trophies. But now it's high time. It's time to realize and work. Work hard as well as smart. I like to announce something to the world and then I like to achieve it. Say I will do X. So the commitment i did back in dec 2021 that I see myself as a DevOps engineer in 5 years. 2 years have passed and I haven't yet started. So I did do some havoc astrology thingy and am starting my journey from today. I searched the web didn't found a resource which has everything in one place. I was and am currently doing python and a bit of web-D.

As a devops engineer u got to know many things. From development to deployment to maintenance everything.
Now, I don't believe that one fine morning I will wake after a dream and become a Devops engineer. It's a process, a process which I am initializing now. And this repo will keep a track of what I have done so far and what all am I learning each day.
So cheers to my evergreen support. I won't take the name but one day If you'll read this you'll get to know. Thanks for being there, thanks for hearing to all of my rants.

Let's Gooo!
